Repository to store pages for my personal site

Site includes an index page, from which I have stored links to a short resume and biography of myself.

In addition, I have included various images, all of which are stored in this repository.
Time spent constructing site - approximately 5-10 hours including setting up github and praciticing adding and commiting
content to my github repository. Making changes to my files and testing site functionality were much easier once I became 
comfortable using git, overall becoming much more streamlined.
