		<p>I was born in Vienna Austria, and have spent much of my early childhood and adolescence living abroad. I returned to Fairfax, Virginia after having lived in countries such as Brazil, Portugal, and Ecuador for over ten years. I have always enjoyed games, whether it be board games or computer games, for as long as I can remember. At various points in my youth I played either basketball or ran track, exercising both my body and my mind. I graduated high school from The Potomac School in McLean, Virginia in 2014 and am currently an undergraduate student at Tufts University studying Computer Science. I enjoy my life as a fraternity brother at Zeta Beta Tau, a hopeful member of the Cheese club, a member of the Tufts Gaming Club, and overall a Renaissance man.</p>
